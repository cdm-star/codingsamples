For P1, I creating dogs in a grid with Dom elements, and the user changing the canvas in some way with the Dom elements

I learn more about JavaScript and understand more depth on Javascript. I learn about classes and inheritance of class
and how to use dom elements more in depth. I made this
by First built all the drawing of the dogs will be present
and how they would be visualized onto the canvas, next I would make classes, then make the dom elements and making them functioning, Lastly I made sure the animating was working of the grid of dogs that I had.
