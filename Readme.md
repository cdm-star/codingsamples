For P2,I learn more about JavaScript and understand more depth on Javascript.
I learn about classes and inheritance of class and how to use dom elements more in depth. 
I made this by First built all the drawing of the dogs will be present and how they would be visualized onto the canvas.
Next I would make classes, then make the dom elements and making them functioning, 
Lastly I made sure the animating was working of the grid of dogs that I had.
